DSPacketCapture 0.1b by yellowstar

This program is incomplete, as it can only capture WMB beacons.

Usage:
Copy to your card, DLDI patched, run it. Use L and R to change channels.
Captured packets will be displayed on-screen and saved to capture.cap in libpcap format,
on the root of your card.
