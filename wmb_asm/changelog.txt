Wmb Asm PC changelog

2.0b r3

Added support for 802.11 captures that don't use AVS.


2.0b r2

Fixed flaws in the module Read Me. Install instructions are now on a Wiki page on the Google Code project page.
Previously, assemble.bat, assembleRSA.bat, and the captures directory were missing from the command-line download,
and the package. These have been added.

2.0b

A lot of changes since 1.2c. Updating to 2.0b is a must, or at least when
2.0 final is released.

1.2c
Wrote my own libpcap capture reading code, so even captures with
truncated packets can be read.

1.2b
A bug with the "DS DOWNLOAD PLAY" string has been fixed. CRC checksum
bugs in the header were fixed. This used to cause the RSA-signature to
be invalidated, meaning that the binary wouldn't work when sent over
WMB to an unflashed DS.

1.2
Icon bug fixed, and other bugs fixed, too. The DS Download Station client
can now be assembled. Captures of transfers from Juglak's WMB Host can now be
assembled. Multiple captures can now be assembled at once.

1.0
Initial release.
