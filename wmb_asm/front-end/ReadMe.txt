Wmb Asm Front-End v0.1b by yellowstar 07/11/08

This GUI program assembles libpcap .cap files of DS WMB Download Play captures into a .nds.

This program is very incomplete. You can't even attempt to assemble anything with this yet.

Compiling
This program was built with the GNU compiler, but others should work, but some changes might be needed for other compilers.
Makefile.win is the Makefile for compiling for PC/Windows. You'll probably need to edit this to make it compile on other platforms.
This program is written with wxWidgets, and the IDE used is wxDev-Cpp.
You can obtain the source code from SVN, from the Google Code project page.
